# Financial Analysis Script

This script helps you analyze financial data stored in a CSV file and provides a summary of the data. It calculates important metrics such as the total number of months, net profit/loss, and average change, and identifies the dates with the greatest profit increase and decrease.

## How to Use

The following tasks will be carried out by the script:
- It will read the CSV file that you have prepared.
- It will calculate different financial metrics using the data.
- The analysis results will be displayed on the screen.
- The analysis results will be saved in a text file called `financial_analysis.txt`.med `financial_analysis.txt`.

## What the Script Does

The script reads a CSV file, analyzes financial data, and calculates various metrics such as total months, net profit/loss, and average change. It also records the dates of the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The results are displayed on the screen.

Additionally, the script saves the analysis results in a text file named `financial_analysis.txt` for future reference.

## Output

The script provides the following information:
- Total Months: The number of months covered by the financial data.
- Total: The net profit or loss during the entire period.
- Average Change: The average difference in profit/loss per month.
- Greatest Increase in Profits: The date and amount of the biggest profit increase.
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: The date and amount of the biggest profit decrease.

You can see these results on the screen when you run the script, and they will also be saved in the `financial_analysis.txt` file.

# Election Analysis Script

This script analyzes election data stored in a CSV file and generates a summary of the data. It calculates the total number of votes, and the percentage of votes for each candidate, and identifies the winner of the election.

## Usage

To run the script, use a Python interpreter. Once executed, the script will read the election data from a CSV file, calculate different election metrics based on that data, display the analysis results on the screen, and save the analysis results to a text file named `election_results.txt`. The text file will be stored in a folder called `Analysis`.

## What the Script Does

This script uses required libraries and specifies the path to the input CSV file. It sets variables for election data and reads the CSV file, increasing the vote count for each candidate. The script shows the election outcomes, computes the percentage of votes each candidate received, identifies the winner, and saves the analysis report to a text file.

## Output

The script provides the following election analysis results:

- Total Votes: The total number of votes cast in the election.
- Percentage of Votes: The percentage of votes received by each candidate.
- Winner: The candidate who received the most votes.

These results are displayed in both the console output and the `election_results.txt` file.

# Aditional Notes

To enhance the clarity of the decision-making process, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed explanations in the scripts. By providing reasoning behind each decision point, readers can better comprehend the overall process, leading to better outcomes and more informed decision-making.
